        <p>Although we love great burger recipes, a seared steak or even a weeknight chicken cookout, ribs are the
            ultimate grilled meal. They’re messy, indulgent, delicious and turn an ordinary summer afternoon into a
            festive occasion.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>When learning how to grill ribs, it may seem intimidating because they require more time over the coals than
        many other types of meat. Here’s the truth: Because they cook low and slow, they actually have a wider window of
        perfection than something like, say, a T-bone steak that relies on a savvy sense of timing and temperature. If
        you take some time to prep ribs correctly and learn where to cook on the grill, they’re easy enough even for
        beginners.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

        <h2>For the marinade:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>3/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar, divided</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <h2>For The Meat:</h2>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>Dash cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <h2>Step 1: Prep the Meat:</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Most store-bought ribs have what’s known as silverskin, a membrane over the underside of the ribs. Sometimes,
            if you’re lucky, your butcher will remove it for you. Otherwise, you need to remove it before you cook.
            Don’t panic, it’s simple to do.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Insert a knife between the membrane and the meat at one end of the ribs. Be careful not to pierce the
            membrane. Work your fingers under the skin to loosen it. Now you’re going to tug it off. Wrap a paper towel
            around your hand so you can get a good grip. Gently but firmly, pull off the silverskin. It should peel off
            quite cleanly.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Step 2:Make The Marinade</h2>
    <div>
        <p>Pork is tasty as is, but marinating before cooking ribs on a charcoal grill enhances the flavor. It adds a
            deep savoriness that makes the meat more satisfying and delicious.</p>

        <p>Making a marinade is easy. It’s really just stirring together a variety of liquids and spices and letting the
            meat soak in them overnight. For this recipe, combine the broth, soy sauce, ½ cup sugar, vinegar, olive oil
            and garlic in a bowl or measuring cup with a pour spout. Place the ribs in a shallow baking dish, like a
            13×9. Pour two-thirds of the marinade over the meat. Turn to coat both sides, then refrigerate overnight.
            Turn the meat occasionally, to ensure that the meat is marinading evenly. (No need to get out of bed to do
            this. Just turn at night just before bedtime and turn again in the morning.</p>

        <p>Don’t toss that remaining marinade. Cover and refrigerate it. You’ll use it while you’re grilling.</p>

        <h2>Step 3: Treat the meat to a spice rub</h2>
        <p>Trust us: You want to add the spice rub. Like making the marinade, it’s simple to prep, just tossing some
            ingredients together in a bowl. Here, we use the remaining ½ cup sugar, plus salt and seasonings.</p>

        <p>Take the ribs out of the fridge. Drain and discard the marinade from the 13×9. Pat the ribs dry (this helps
            the spice rub stick). Rub the spice mixture over all sides of the ribs, patting with your fingertips to
            encourage it to adhere.</p>

        <p>Test Kitchen Tip: When it comes to ribs, some people only use a marinade. Some people only use spice rub. We
            like to do both! Marinading adds layers of flavor that penetrate deep into the meat, while the spice rub
            adds flavor to the surface of the meat. When the grill sears the ribs, the spicy, crackling exterior of the
            meat makes a delicious contrast to the tender, succulent meat inside.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Step 4: Grill</h2>
    <p>Here’s the real secret to how to cook ribs: Cook them over indirect flames, and give them time. This lets the
        connective tissue melt away, leaving you with perfectly tender, toothsome ribs. If you cook them too quickly,
        over high heat, the meat can turn out chewy and tough.</p>

    <p>First, preheat a clean grill to medium heat (about 200°F), then oil the grill. </p>
    <p>Place the ribs right on the grill, using tongs to maneuver them into place. Grill, covered, over indirect medium
        heat for 30 minutes on each side.
    </p>
    <p>After the first hour, move the ribs to direct medium heat and cook 20-40 minutes longer, or until the pork is
        tender (more on this in a minute).</p>
    <p>Occasionally, turn and baste with the reserved marinade (or barbecue sauce, if you prefer).</p>
    <h2>Step 5: Test for doneness </h2>
    <p>We’ve all heard the old saying: Ribs should “fall off the bone.” But should your ribs really fall off the bone?
        Our Test Kitchen experts say no. We can all agree that chewy ribs are no fun, but if the meat is literally
        falling off the bones, then the ribs are overcooked and might be dry.</p>

    <p>Start testing for doneness once the meat begins to pull away from the ends of the bones. This visual cue means
        it’s time to test. Pierce the meat with a fork and the tines should glide through easily. You also can twist a
        rib bone a little bit; you should feel it move easily but not fall apart from the meat. If the meat falls off
        the bone, your ribs are overcooked. Remove from heat right away and make sure to have sauce at the table in case
        they’re a bit dry. Don’t beat yourself up! Next time, remember to check earlier.</p>

    <p>Overall, your ribs should be cooked to a temperature of about 190°F. This high temperature melts the tough
        collagen in muscle fiber, resulting in a tender rib. To take the temperature of your ribs, insert a meat
        thermometer ($99) into the meat, being sure not to pierce through the meat or touch the bone.</p>
    <h2>Step 6: Let Rest and Enjoy</h2>

    <p>By now, you’ve certainly built up an appetite. After letting your ribs rest for 10-15 minutes, you’ll want to
        split them up into manageable portions. Using a sharp chef’s knife, carefully cut them into two-bone sections.
        Make the cuts as close to the bone as possible so there’s a lot of meat on each one.</p>

        <p>Serve with corn on the cob, big glasses of lemonade and a fistful of napkins for everyone. Looking for more
        sauces to slather on your ribs? Here are a few of our favorite homemade BBQ sauce recipes.</p>
